This repository contains experimental reports and training results for a replication of the SimpleRL_Reason project, specifically documenting outcomes from training on the qwen2.5-math-1.5b model.

I want to express my appreciation to the authors of the SimpleRL-Reason project.

This is solid work. By open-sourcing this project, you've provided a valuable foundation for the community and a starting point for my own experiments and replications.
